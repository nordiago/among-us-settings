## Preset Files

To use the preset files in this repository, download and place them in the following folder:
```
\Users\<User>\AppData\LocalLow\Innersloth\Among Us
```
The above path can be reached directly by pasting it into an Explorer window with your corresponding `<User>` name.

Alternatively, the `AppData` folder can be reached by searching for `%appdata%` from the taskbar. In the window that opens, navigate up one level to get out of `Roaming`. Then click into `LocalLow` and onward.

Once the preset files are placed, create an **Among Us** lobby, go to the "Game" tab of the `Customize` laptop, click "Load Custom Settings", and select the slot corresponding to the number in the filename (1-3).

Note that general game settings (see the table above) need to be adjusted manually as they are not part of the *Town Of Us* mod and can't be controlled by it.
